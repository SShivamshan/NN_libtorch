This folder contains the Mnist Dataset found from here :  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset 

For the Oxford Dataset, which was found here : https://academictorrents.com/details/b18bbd9ba03d50b0f7f479acc9f4228a408cecc1. Once downloaded place these annotation and images folder inside a folder. 

But the images are corrupted not many but few, thus i found this solution on this github page : https://github.com/ml4py/dataset-iiit-pet/tree/master which has the corrected dataset. This dataset contains the image in ".jpg" and ".mat" format 

You may simply collect the uncorrupted images and them to the dataset or just download the above mentionned dataset itself.
